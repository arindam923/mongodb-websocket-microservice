# MongoDB WebSocket Microservice

This microservice provides real-time messaging functionality using WebSocket and MongoDB for storage. It's a simple messaging system where clients can send and receive messages, and the messages are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arindam/mongodb-websocket-microservice.git
    ```
   
2. **Create a .env file in the project root and set your MongoDB URI:**
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/joho/godotenv
    go get -u github.com/gorilla/websocket
    go get -u go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo
    ```
